1.  Agile Scrum Process:
1.1 Product Backlog:

What: A prioritized list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes that need to be addressed in the product.
How to use: Continuously refined and updated by the Product Owner, serving as a dynamic document to guide the team.

1.2 Sprint Planning Meeting:

What: A collaborative session where the team and Product Owner discuss and plan the work for the upcoming sprint.
How to use: Establishes the Sprint Goal and selects items from the Product Backlog for the Sprint Backlog.

1.3 Sprint Backlog:

What: A subset of the Product Backlog items selected for the current sprint, with tasks and estimates.
How to use: Guides the team's work during the sprint, ensuring focus on high-priority items.

1.4 Product Owner:

What: Represents stakeholders and defines the features of the product. Responsible for maintaining the Product Backlog.
How to use: Works closely with the team during planning, provides clarifications, and accepts/rejects work results.

1.5 Scrum Master:

What: Facilitates and ensures adherence to Scrum principles and practices. Removes impediments to the team's progress.
How to use: Supports the team in self-organization, helps to improve processes, and ensures a positive team dynamic.

1.6 Daily Meeting:

What: A brief, daily stand-up meeting where team members share progress, plans, and any impediments.
How to use: Promotes communication, collaboration, and keeps the team focused on achieving the Sprint Goal.

1.7 Sprint Review:

What: A meeting at the end of the sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the Product Backlog.
How to use: Allows stakeholders to provide feedback, and the team and Product Owner to adjust the backlog based on lessons learned.

1.8 Sprint:

What: A time-boxed iteration (usually 2-4 weeks) where the team works to deliver a potentially shippable product increment.
How to use: The core operational unit of Scrum, providing a predictable and consistent cadence for development and feedback.
This Agile Scrum process provides a framework for iterative and incremental development, fostering collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement.
